        <h3 class="question">What is A Shot for Life(ASFL)?</h3>
        <p>
            A Shot for Life is a Cancer research nonprofit that raises money for Mass General Hospital through a variety of sports events. Every year hundreds of athletes will wear an ASFL jersey and band together to step on the floor, field, or rink for all those who canâ€™t.
        </p>
        <h3 class="question">My role:</h3>
        <p>
            I was given the opportunity to intern for A Shot for Life the summer after my freshman year. During that time I worked on a variety of initiatives including but not limited too:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The addition of three new initiatives, The Courage Cup(Soccer), The ASFL Bowl(Football), and the ASFL Classic(Hockey)</li>
            <li>The addition of the ASFL Pitchers challenge to ASFL Baseball and Softball</li>
            <li>The addition of the ASFL Basketball All-Star Game</li>
            <li>Running numerous events including the ASFL Gauntlet, a 24 hour basketball event with over 350 participants</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            On top of these responsibilities I got to make meaningful connections to many members of the A Shot for Life community. I also got to see first hand that we were making a difference. The money we raised is helping fund groundbreaking trails at MGH. Although my time as an intern is over, my time with ASFL is not. I am still a very active member of the community and help wherever I am needed!
